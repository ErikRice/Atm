# Atm
Welcome to Atm! This is a simple little app that lets you add or subtract from the deposit that you control. 

## How To
First, select the type of transaction you would like to make, either deposit or cash back. Next, using the arrows or type in function, choose how much money you would like to deposit or withdrawl. Finally, hit submit! The account total will be displayed at the very top. There are features that keep you from withdrawing more money than what the current total is. Also, take notice that you will not see the money input unless you select either deposit or cash back.

## Future Additions
I would like to change the style a bit more as well as split up the components into seperate files in React. I would also like to add a feature that allows you to save accounts in a list on the page.
